# Title: Disease Classification
# Abstract: Using a dataset from kaggle with 132 symptoms, a neural network will be created in order to classify 41 diseases. The goal of this model is for a user to be able to assess their illness using binary symptom tracking. In order to train the model the 4962 total data points are split into 4000 training and 942 testing, including at least one case of each disease in the training set. Once the model is established it will be evaluated for diagnosis accuracy based on each disease.
