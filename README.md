# Title: Disease Classification
# Abstract: Using a dataset from kaggle with 132 symptoms, a neural network will be created in order to classify 41 diseases. The goal of this model is for a user to be able to assess their illness using binary symptom tracking. In order to train the model the 4962 total data points are split into 4000 training and 942 testing, including at least one case of each disease in the training set. Once the model is established it will be evaluated for diagnosis accuracy based on each disease.
# In Disease_Detection.ipynb the first thing that is required is to download the data_set.csv file to either your device or google drive. Then the data should be uploaded to files portion of the jupyter notebook so it is accessible. As a user their is nothing else that needs to be done. 
# Disease_Detection.ipynb consists of importing the data_set.csv, and then preprocessing the data by converting it to one-hot encoding so that each case is assigned to a specific disease diagnosis. The data is split into training, testing, and validation. Then a LSTM model is ran, using 3 layers with 315,689 trainable parameters. The model is then evaluated using the test data, and a heat map is created from the confusion matrix.
